# Where are all my repos?

GitHub's pretty much Copilot's training cesspool, I don't want to take part in it, so I took all my repositories and deleted them. I have my own Forgejo-based Git server over at [git.gianmarco.gg](https://git.gianmarco.gg) in hope that no weird bots that are integrated into the platform would just screw over licenses.

That's all I had to say, have a nice day and f-u Microsoft.
